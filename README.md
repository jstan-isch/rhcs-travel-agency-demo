App Dev Cloud with JBoss Travel Agency Demo
===========================================
This demo is to install JBoss BPM Travel Agency Demo in the Cloud based on leveraging the OpenShift Container Platform (OCP)
It delivers a fully functioning JBoss BPM Travel Agency example containerized on OCP.

This is an online employee travel booking process project. It contains multiple web services for looking up data for the process
and rules to calculate pricing. Furthermore, there are several tasks that can be activated to evaluate pricing and to review the
final booking data before completing the booking.


Install JBoss Travel Agency on OpenShift
----------------------------------------
1. First ensure you have an OpenShift container based installation, such as one of the followling installed first:

  - [OCP Install Demo](https://github.com/redhatdemocentral/ocp-install-demo)

  - [CDK Install Demo](https://github.com/redhatdemocentral/cdk-install-demo)

  - or your own OpenShift installation.

2. [Download and unzip this demo.](https://github.com/redhatdemocentral/rhcs-travel-agency-demo/archive/master.zip)

3. Add products to installs directory.

4. Run 'init.sh' or 'init.bat' file. 'init.bat' must be run with Administrative privileges:
```
   # The installation needs to be pointed to a running version
   # of OpenShift, so pass an IP address such as:
   #
   $ ./init.sh 192.168.99.100  # example for OCP.

   $ ./init.sh 10.1.2.2        # example for CDK.
```

Log in to JBoss Travel Agency to start exploring an online bookings application (the address will be generated by the init script):

  - OCP example: [http://rhcs-travel-agency-demo.192.168.99.100.xip.io/business-central](http://rhcs-travel-agency-demo.192.168.99.100.xip.io/business-central)  ( u:erics / p:bpmsuite1! )

  - OCP example web app: [http://rhcs-travel-agency-demo.192.168.99.100.xip.io/external-client-ui-form-1.0](http://rhcs-travel-agency-demo.192.168.99.100.xip.io/external-client-ui-form-1.0)

  - CDK example: [http://rhcs-travel-agency-demo.10.1.2.2.xip.io/business-central](http://rhcs-travel-agency-demo.10.1.2.2.xip.io/business-central)  ( u:erics / p:bpmsuite1! )

  - CDK example web app: [http://rhcs-travel-agency-demo.10.1.2.2.xip.io/external-client-ui-form-1.0](http://rhcs-travel-agency-demo.10.1.2.2.xip.io/external-client-ui-form-1.0)


Note before running demo:
-------------------------
This project can be installed on any OpenShift platform, such as OpenShift Container Platform or Red Hat Container Development Kit.
It's possible to install it on any available installation by pointing this installer to an OpenShift IP address:
```
  $ ./init.sh IP
```

If for any reason the installation breaks or you want a new installation, just remove the project entry in the OpenShift console and re-run the installation.

Should your local network DNS not handle the resolution of the above address, giving you page not found errors, you can apply the
following to your local hosts file:

```
$ sudo vi /etc/hosts

# add host for OCP demo resulution
192.168.99.100   rhcs-travel-agency-demo.192.168.99.100.xip.io 

# add host for CDK demo resolution.
10.1.2.2   rhcs-travel-agency-demo.10.1.2.2.xip.io 
```

Booking a trip to Edinburgh (just one scenario)

  ```

3. Login to Business Central.

  ```

4. Two web services will be run and a sub-process to calculate the cost before deciding it is not needed that this booking be
	 reviewed on pricing, so you will find a task 'Employee Booking' for you to process.

   calculated by the rules. You can request a review to send it back for a pricing review or check the completed box to 
   finish the task and process (isBookingConfirmed). All tasks have automated reassignment, meaning if not completed within 1 minute
   they will be put back into the group.

8. Enter credit card details (beginning with 1234...) for compensation to be triggered., Expiry details of the 
   card (e.g. 12/12) and your full name.

9. Check the logs and you will see that the process has been compensated.

    card number that does not begin with 1234....
