JBoss BPM Suite Travel Agency Demo - COMPENSATION
==================================================
The online travel booking process has been extended to include compensation. But what is Compensation?

This is an online employee travel booking process project. It contains multimple web services for looking up data for the process
and rules to calculate pricing. Furthermore, there are several tasks that can be activated to evaluate pricing and to review the
final booking data before completing the booking.

Welcome to the JBoss BPM Travel Agency!


Compensation
-------------
Compensation is a means for rolling back the effects of an action. For example, say you charge the amount of 10â‚¬ to a credit card.
If you later detect that this was an error, you may want to undo this. One way of doing that is crediting the same account with the
amount that would have been charged by the purchase that you are rolling back.

This sounds like something that can be handled with transactions... only that there are a couple of problems:

    1. The service you are using might not support transactions.

    2. You might notice that it was a mistake to charge the credit card too late, at sometime past where the transaction already committed.

In both cases we cannot simply go back in time and fix the action taken. On the contrary, we need to make something else happen, in order to compensate the effects of an action we erroneously committed.


How it works in our process
---------------------------
Compensation is set up in our process to roll back or return any flight seats and hotel rooms that have been booked in the event of
a failure to collect payment from the customers credit card. The process books airline seats and hotel rooms before then proceeding
to attmpt to collect payment from a credit card. 

In our process we have a built in fraudulent credit card check, if any credit card is fraudulent (i.e. begins with 1234...) then
process will compensate the booked airline seats and hotel rooms.
